    "corequisites": "",
    "description": "This course is the first of two connected calculus courses (followed by MATH 205). This course focuses on an overview of functions and limits; derivative as rate of change, differentiation of elementary functions (power, exponential, logarithmic, trigonometric); differentiation rules (product, quotient, and chain rules); implicit differentiation; higher derivatives; approximations using linearization and the differential. Applications include related rates; optimization, analysis of functions (determining maxima, minima and inflection points) and graphing.",

    "description": "This is an introductory course in elementary linear algebra. In this course, students learn algebra and geometry of vectors, dot and cross products, lines and planes. A key objective is learning methods to solve systems of linear equations, which are reformulated with matrix multiplication, matrix inversion, and determinants. Finally, these methods are clarified through linear transformations.",
